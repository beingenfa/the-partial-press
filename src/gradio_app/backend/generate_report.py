# Global prompt for generating biased news.
BIASED_NEWS_PROMPT = '''
Objective: Given a scenario, write four short, scandalous, and fear-driven newspaper articles designed to outrage the public. Each article must take a strong, one-sided stance, sensationalistic 'culture war' style , twisting or omitting facts to maximize shock and fear.

Perspectives: Create four versions of the controversy. 
1) Villainizing Alex
2) Villainizing Jordan
3) Villainizing Alex (while painting Jordan as a hero)
4) Villainizing Jordan (while painting Alex as a hero)

Writing Style: Use simple, everyday language like a viral blog post, not traditional news. Keep sentences short and punchy with no complex words or neutral analysis. The tone should be dramatic and emotional, making readers angry, scared, or outraged. The writing should be subtly manipulative, leading readers to the conclusion without stating bias outright. End each article with a sense of fear, leaving readers worried about what happens next (not a question).

Article Structure:
- A scandalous headline (bold, dramatic, clickbait-worthy).
- A short report (five to seven sentences, aggressive, biased, designed to provoke).

Output Format (valid JSON):
{
  "villainizing_alex": {
    "headline": "YOUR HEADLINE HERE",
    "report": "YOUR REPORT HERE"
  },
  "villainizing_jordan": {
    "headline": "YOUR HEADLINE HERE",
    "report": "YOUR REPORT HERE"
  },
  "villainizing_alex_painting_jordan_as_hero": {
    "headline": "YOUR HEADLINE HERE",
    "report": "YOUR REPORT HERE"
  },
  "villainizing_jordan_painting_alex_as_hero": {
    "headline": "YOUR HEADLINE HERE",
    "report": "YOUR REPORT HERE"
  }
}

Goal: Make the reader feel like they discovered the "truth" themselvesâ€”angry, betrayed, and afraid of what comes next.
