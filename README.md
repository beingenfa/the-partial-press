**The Partial Press** is an LLM-powered tool designed to generate biased news reports based on interactions between two individuals. This project serves as a demonstration of how the same event can be framed in vastly different ways, highlighting the role of **narratives and framing** in modern media and their implications for **inference analysis**.  

## ðŸ“° Project Overview

For the purposes of this demo:  

- The website provides **10 predefined scenarios** featuring two charactersâ€”**Alex and Jordan**.  
- The **LLM processes the scenario** as input and generates multiple biased summaries based on different perspectives.  
- The results illustrate how news narratives can shape public perception and impact **downstream applications**. 

This project aligns with my ongoing PhD research on **narratives and framing in NLP**, serving as a demonstration of why **understanding narrative construction and extracting facts from biased accounts is crucial**.
